##Ref updated sentiment analysis file##

Change this code in such a way that:

it has 3 LSTM layers

it has used a for loop to do so in the forward function

the dropout value used is 0.2

trained on the text that is reversed (for example "my name is Rohan" becomes "Rohan is name my"

achieves 87% or more accuracy

once done, share the Github link as well (after training on Google Colab, move the file to GitHub).
